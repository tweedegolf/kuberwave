# Kuberwave

Conveniently generate and deploy Kubernetes projects for real production applications.

Kuberwave provides:
* A relatively compact form to write deployments in.
* Frequently occurring patterns such as ingress and certificate definitions.
* Multi-environment inventories similar to Ansible.
* A convenient method of storing secrets in your repositories with ansible-vault.
* Checks whether you have provided all required environment variables.
* Locally deploy your projects in a reproducible manner.
* Conveniently deploy on your CI servers.

## Projects

### Generate

```
# ./target/debug/kuberwave generate -h
kuberwave-generate
Generates a configuration and writes to a directory

USAGE:
   kuberwave generate [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <manifest-path>

FLAGS:
   -d, --dry-run    Do not actually write the configuration
   -h, --help       Prints help information
   -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
   -i, --inventory <inventory-path>    Path to inventory file
   -o, --output <output-path>          Path to output directory [default: ./result]

ARGS:
   <manifest-path>    Path to manifest file
```

### Deploy
Directly deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.
Deploys to `kubectl` default cluster or to the default cluster specified with `--kubeconfig`.
Optionally you can authenticate to the cluster with a separate `--token`.

This command is primarily designed to be used by Continuous Integration (CI) environments.

```
# ./target/debug/kuberwave deploy -h
kuberwave-deploy
Deploys a configuration to the current cluster

USAGE:
    kuberwave deploy [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <manifest-path>

FLAGS:
    -d, --dry-run    Do not actually write the configuration
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -i, --inventory <inventory-path>      Path to inventory file
    -c, --kubeconfig <kubeconfig-path>    Path to kubeconfig file
    -t, --token <token-path>              Path to token file, encrypted with SECRET

ARGS:
    <manifest-path>    Path to manifest file
```

### Getting deploy tokens
Use the `bin/extract-token.sh` script to quickly get the deploy token for a
basic service account generated after running kubectl on the files generated by
`cluster-generate`. If this doesn't work, follow these steps to get the deploy
token manually: You can fetch the token by executing the following with
`kubectl`:

```
# kubectl describe serviceaccount example-ci
Name:                example-ci
Namespace:           default
Labels:              <none>
Annotations:         kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration:
                       {"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"ServiceAccount","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"example-ci","namespace":"default"}}
Image pull secrets:  <none>
Mountable secrets:   example-ci-token-rpg9x
Tokens:              example-ci-token-rpg9x
Events:              <none>

# kubectl get secret example-ci-token-rpg9x -o=jsonpath='{.data.token}'| base64 --decode
<snip token>
```

Service accounts are populated using `cluster-generate`. Only kubernetes
cluster admins can deploy service accounts, so ask your local admin to get it
for you. Deploy tokens need to be encrypted using `ansible-vault` and your
`SECRET`.

## Inspect serviceaccount privileges
An admin can inspect the privileges handed out to all service account *per namespace* using the following invocation or similar:

```kubectl auth can-i --as system:serviceaccount:default:woz-viewer-ci --list -n woz-viewer-production```

Currently we provide two clusterroles via clustergenerate:
* *role-all*: a role that gives all permissions. When bound as a RoleBinding for a specific namespace, will only grant all permissions for that namespace, except for changing more RoleBindings and Roles. When handed out as an ClusterRoleBinding, will grant all permissions.
* *role-view-unprivileged*: a role that gives read-only (read, watch, list) privileges on all objects, except for Secrets.

Generally all service accounts related to users get cluster-wide view-unprivileged access, and global access for concrete namespaces.

## Cluster (generate)

Generates specific cluster definition files such as serviceaccounts and rolebindings.

```
# ./target/debug/kuberwave cluster-generate -h
kuberwave-cluster-generate
Generates a cluster configuration and writes to a directory

USAGE:
    kuberwave cluster-generate [OPTIONS] <manifest-path>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -o, --output <output-path>    Path to output directory [default: ./result]

ARGS:
    <manifest-path>    Path to manifest file
```

As a Kubernetes cluster admin you can deploy the resulting files by running:

```
# kubectl apply -Rf ./result/apply
# kubectl auth reconcile -f ./result/auth
```

## Running in docker
You can run `kuberwave` in docker such that it is reproducible, both locally and on a CI-server.
Here is an example script for a typical deployment with an inventory.

You need to set:
* `SECRET`: your ansible vault password
* `ENV`: to the name of your inventory

```
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Deploying $TAG to $ENV"

docker pull ghcr.io/tweedegolf/kuberwave:latest
docker run \
    -e SECRET="$SECRET" \
    -v `pwd`:/app \
    -w /app/deployment \
      ghcr.io/tweedegolf/kuberwave:latest \
      kuberwave deploy \
        --token=./deploy.token \
        --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig.yml \
        --inventory="./inventory/$ENV.yml" \
        ./manifest.yml
```
